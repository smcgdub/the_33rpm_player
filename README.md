# **The 33 RPM Player** #
![]()

## **Introduction** ##
A few years ago somebody uploaded the song Jolene by Dolly Parton that was played on a record player at 33rpm instead of the intended 45rpm, you can listen to that song on YouTube by clicking [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMrfM711vXI). 

The song gained a lot of attention online as many people thought it sounded as good as, if not better than the original. I thought what other songs would sound good at 33rpm, hence the inspiration for this project. 

I also haven’t built a project yet using ChatGPT, so for this simple project I said I would build the entire thing using nothing more than prompts on Bing chat which is powered by ChatGPT 4.  

Im also very well aware that you can watch a music video on YouTube or on any media player and set the speed to a slower speed to achieve the same effect. This project was not about building a new technology. It was about seeing how i could build a simple project using nothing more than prompts on Bing chat with little or no coding from me as the developer.

The full conversation with bing chat and all of the prompts, replies and code generated can be found in section 9 of this document. My summary on the project can be read in section 10.

<summary>1. User Experience (UX)</summary>
<br>

### **1.1 - Target Audience** ###

Anyone who wishes to hear one of their favourite songs played at 33rpm.

### **1.2 - Visitor goals** ###

As a visitor to The 33RPM Player I want to be able to upload a song and hear it played at 33rpm.

### **1.3 - User Stories** ###

**As a visitor to The 33RPM Player want/expect/need:**

1. A simple user interface that is easy to navigate.
2. To be able to upload a song and hear it played at 33rpm.
3. To be able to fast forward and rewind the song.
4. To be able to see the name of the song that is playing.
5. To be able to see an error message if i try to upload a file that is not an audio file.

### **1.4 - Design Choices** ###

As i made this project completely using prompts in Bing chat i decided i would make any design choices in advance and decide on things as i go. 

**COLOURS**

I would prompt Bing chat with different requests as the project progressed and then use the responses to help me decide on the design choices.

<summary>2. Features</summary>
<br>

### **2.1 - The drop zone** ###

The clearly marked drop zone is where desktop users must drag the audio file they wish to listen to at 33rpm.

### **2.2 - Upload file** ###

For mobile users who don't have the drag and drop functionality they can click on the upload file button and select the file they wish to listen to at 33rpm.

### **2.3 - The player** ###

A standard HTML player that Bing chat generated when i gave it the prompt.


### **2.4 - Fast Forward & Rewind Buttons** ###

The fast forward and rewind buttons are standard HTML buttons that Bing chat generated when i gave it the prompt. The Javascript behind them allows users to skip forward or backwards by 10 seconds per click. All of the Javascript functionality was generated by Bing chat when i gave it the prompt.

### **2.5 - Song Name** ###

The song/file name is displayed to the user after the player loads it.

### **2.6 - Error Message** ###

If the user tries to upload a file that is not an audio file they will be presented with an error message.

Below you can see the entire conversation i had with Bing chat to build this project. Text written in green is the response from Bing chat. All of the code generated that you see below was generated from Bing chat. 

<hr>

<strong>Prompt 1:</strong><br> 
I want to build a website where users can drag an audio file and an audio player will play the song back at 33rpm. Let’s discuss the tech stack needed to do this

<strong>Response</strong><br> 
Sure! To build a website with the functionality you described, you’ll need to use a combination of front-end and back-end technologies. For the front-end, you can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the user interface and handle user interactions such as dragging and dropping an audio file. For the back-end, you can use a server-side language such as PHP or Node.js to process the audio file and play it back at 33rpm. You’ll also need a web server such as Apache or Nginx to host your website.

Is there a specific technology or language you prefer to use?<br>
1 of 24

<hr>

<strong>Prompt 2:</strong><br> 
The user won’t be able to store any music, they will only be able to drag and drop 1 song at a time, so no need for any backend

<strong>Response</strong><br> 
In that case, you can build the website using only front-end technologies. You can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the user interface and handle user interactions such as dragging and dropping an audio file. You can also use JavaScript to process the audio file and play it back at 33rpm using the Web Audio API.

Do you have any experience with these technologies?<br>
2 of 24

<hr>

<strong>Prompt 3</strong><br> 
Yes I have experience with these. Can you generate the html code for me?

<strong>Response</strong><br> 
Sure! Here’s a basic HTML template that you can use as a starting point for your website:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Audio Player</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Audio Player</h1>
    <p>Drag and drop an audio file here:</p>
    <div id="dropzone" style="width: 300px; height: 100px; border: 2px dashed #ccc;"></div>
    <audio id="player" controls></audio>
    <script>
      // Your JavaScript code goes here
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

![](/images/1.png)
<br>
Preview of player generated

This template includes a dropzone element where users can drag and drop an audio file, and an audio element to play the file. You’ll need to add your own JavaScript code to handle the drag and drop event and play the audio file at 33rpm.

Is there anything else you need help with?<br>
3 of 24

<hr>

<strong>Prompt 4</strong><br> 
OK, now let’s write the JavaScript. When the user drags and drops a song into the player I want the song to start playing at 33rpm automatically. Generate this JavaScript code for me and add it to the html file you generated previously.

<strong>Response</strong><br> 
Sure! Here’s the updated HTML template with the added JavaScript code to handle the drag and drop event and play the audio file at 33rpm:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Audio Player</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Audio Player</h1>
    <p>Drag and drop an audio file here:</p>
    <div id="dropzone" style="width: 300px; height: 100px; border: 2px dashed #ccc;"></div>
    <audio id="player" controls></audio>
    <script>
      // Get the dropzone and player elements
      const dropzone = document.querySelector('#dropzone');
      const player = document.querySelector('#player');

      // Handle the dragover event
      dropzone.addEventListener('dragover', (event) => {
        event.preventDefault();
      });

      // Handle the drop event
      dropzone.addEventListener('drop', (event) => {
        event.preventDefault();

        // Get the dropped file
        const file = event.dataTransfer.files[0];

        // Create a file reader
        const reader = new FileReader();
        reader.onload = (event) => {
          // Set the audio source and play the file at 33rpm
          player.src = event.target.result;
          player.playbackRate = 0.5;
          player.play();
        };
        reader.readAsDataURL(file);
      });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

This code adds event listeners to the dropzone element to handle the dragover and drop events. When a user drags a file over the dropzone, the dragover event is fired and the default behaviour is prevented. When a user drops a file onto the dropzone, the drop event is fired and the dropped file is read using a FileReader. Once the file is read, its data is set as the source of the audio element and played back at 33rpm using the playbackRate property.

<strong>Prompt 5</strong><br> 
I also want the name of the file to be displayed below the player. Generate this code for me and add it to the code

<strong>Response</strong><br> 
Sure! Here’s the updated HTML template with the added code to display the name of the dropped file below the player:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Audio Player</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Audio Player</h1>
    <p>Drag and drop an audio file here:</p>
    <div id="dropzone" style="width: 300px; height: 100px; border: 2px dashed #ccc;"></div>
    <audio id="player" controls></audio>
    <p id="filename"></p>
    <script>
      // Get the dropzone, player, and filename elements
      const dropzone = document.querySelector('#dropzone');
      const player = document.querySelector('#player');
      const filename = document.querySelector('#filename');

      // Handle the dragover event
      dropzone.addEventListener('dragover', (event) => {
        event.preventDefault();
      });

      // Handle the drop event
      dropzone.addEventListener('drop', (event) => {
        event.preventDefault();

        // Get the dropped file
        const file = event.dataTransfer.files[0];

        // Display the file name
        filename.textContent = file.name;

        // Create a file reader
        const reader = new FileReader();
        reader.onload = (event) => {
          // Set the audio source and play the file at 33rpm
          player.src = event.target.result;
          player.playbackRate = 0.5;
          player.play();
        };
        reader.readAsDataURL(file);
      });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

This code adds a new p element with the id of filename to display the name of the dropped file. When a user drops a file onto the dropzone, the drop event is fired and the name of the dropped file is set as the text content of the filename element.

<strong>Prompt 6</strong><br> 
Let’s add a fast-forward button and a rewind button so a user can fast-forward and rewind the song. I don’t want these buttons to skip to the next song, they just fast forward or rewind the current song

<strong>Response</strong><br> 
Sure! Here’s the updated HTML template with the added code to include fast forward and rewind buttons:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Audio Player</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Audio Player</h1>
    <p>Drag and drop an audio file here:</p>

    <button id="fastforward">Fast Forward</button>
    <script>
      // Get the dropzone, player, filename, rewind, and fastforward elements

      const player = document.querySelector('#player');
      const filename = document.querySelector('#filename');
      const rewind = document.querySelector('#rewind');
      const fastforward = document.querySelector('#fastforward');

      // Handle the dragover event
      dropzone.addEventListener('dragover', (event) => {
        event.preventDefault();
      });

      // Handle the drop event
      dropzone.addEventListener('drop', (event) => {
        event.preventDefault();

        // Get the dropped file
        const file = event.dataTransfer.files[0];

        // Display the file name
        filename.textContent = file.name;

        // Create a file reader
        const reader = new FileReader();
        reader.onload = (event) => {
          // Set the audio source and play the file at 33rpm
          player.src = event.target.result;
          player.playbackRate = 0.5;
          player.play();
        };
        reader.readAsDataURL(file);
      });

      // Handle the click event for the rewind button
      rewind.addEventListener('click', () => {
        player.currentTime -= 10;
      });

      // Handle the click event for the fastforward button
      fastforward.addEventListener('click', () => {
        player.currentTime += 10;
      });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

This code adds two new button elements with the ids of rewind and fastforward to allow users to rewind or fast forward the audio by 10 seconds. When a user clicks on one of these buttons, the currentTime property of the audio element is updated to move the playback position backward or forward by 10 seconds.

This code updates the drop and change event handlers to display only the file name without the file extension. When a user drops or selects a file, its name is extracted using a regular expression to remove the file extension before setting it as the text content of the filename element.

Is there a way we can check if the user is dropping or uploading a none audio file? If so how do we check this? And if it’s not an audio file that the player can play, can we generate a message to the user to say "Sorry the type of file you are trying to load cannot be played in this player"

<strong>Response</strong><br>
Yes, it is possible to check if the user is dropping or uploading a non-audio file. You can do this by checking the type property of the dropped or selected file to see if it starts with audio/. If the file is not an audio file, you can display a message to the user to let them know that the file cannot be played.

Here’s the updated HTML template with the added code to check if the dropped or selected file is an audio file and display a message if it’s not

If the user tries to upload a none audio file then the error message is displaying correctly. However, if the user then uploads a correct audio file, the previous error message is still displaying. Adjust the code we are using so if the user uploads an audio file after trying to upload a none audio file, the message that error message that displays "Sorry, the type of file you are trying to load cannot be played in this player." is removed

This code updates the drop and change event handlers to clear any previous error messages when a valid audio file is dropped or selected. If a user drops or selects an audio file after trying to upload a non-audio file, any previous error messages are removed by setting the text content of the message element to an empty string.

<strong>Prompt 11</strong><br> 
If the user drags an audio file and drops it outside of the dropzone then the song will open in a new tab in the browser and play at normal speed. Can we disable this so if the user drags and drops a file outside of the dropzone nothing happens

<strong>Response</strong><br> 
Yes, it is possible to prevent the default behavior of the browser when a user drags and drops a file outside of the dropzone. You can do this by adding an event listener to the document object to handle the dragover and drop events and prevent their default behavior.

Here’s the updated HTML template with the added code to prevent the default behavior of the browser when a user drags and drops a file outside of the dropzone:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>

    <input type="file" id="fileinput" accept="audio/*">
    <audio id="player" controls></audio>
    <p id="filename"></p>
    <p id="message"></p>
    <button id="rewind">Rewind</button>
    <button id="fastforward">Fast Forward</button>
    <script>
      // Get the dropzone, player, filename, message, rewind, fastforward, and fileinput elements
      const dropzone = document.querySelector('#dropzone');
      const player = document.querySelector('#player');
      const filename = document.querySelector('#filename');
      const message = document.querySelector('#message');
      const rewind = document.querySelector('#rewind');
      const fastforward = document.querySelector('#fastforward');
      const fileinput = document.querySelector('#fileinput');

      // Prevent the default behavior for dragover and drop events on the document
      document.addEventListener('dragover', (event) => {
        event.preventDefault();
      });
      document.addEventListener('drop', (event) => {
        event.preventDefault();
      });

      // Handle the dragover event for the dropzone
      dropzone.addEventListener('dragover', (event) => {
        event.preventDefault();
      });

      // Handle the drop event for the dropzone
      dropzone.addEventListener('drop', (event) => {
        event.preventDefault();

        // Get the dropped file
        const file = event.dataTransfer.files[0];

        // Check if the file is an audio file
        if (file.type.startsWith('audio/')) {
          // Clear any previous messages
          message.textContent = "";

          // Display the file name without the extension
          filename.textContent = file.name.replace(/\.[^/.]+$/, "");

          // Create a file reader
          const reader = new FileReader();
          reader.onload = (event) => {
            // Set the audio source and play the file at 33rpm
            player.src = event.target.result;
            player.playbackRate = 0.5;
            player.play();
          };
          reader.readAsDataURL(file);
        } else {
          // Display a message to the user
          message.textContent = "Sorry, the type of file you are trying to load cannot be played in this player.";
        }
      });

      // Handle the change event for the file input
      fileinput.addEventListener('change', (event) => {
        // Get the selected file
        const file = event.target.files[0];

        // Check if the file is an audio file
        if (file.type.startsWith('audio/')) {
          // Clear any previous messages
          message.textContent = "";

          // Display the file name without the extension
          filename.textContent = file.name.replace(/\.[^/.]+$/, "");

          // Create a file reader
          const reader = new FileReader();
          reader.onload = (event) => {
            // Set the audio source and play the file at 33rpm
            player.src = event.target.result;
            player.playbackRate = 0.5;
            player.play();
          };
          reader.readAsDataURL(file);
        } else {
          // Display a message to the user
          message.textContent = "Sorry, the type of file you are trying to load cannot be played in this player.";
        }
      });

      // Handle the click event for the rewind button
      rewind.addEventListener('click', () => {
        player.currentTime -= 10;
      });

      // Handle the click event for the fastforward button
      fastforward.addEventListener('click', () => {
        player.currentTime += 10;
      });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

This code adds two new event listeners to handle dragover and drop events on document. When a user drags a file over or drops a file onto any part of document, these events are fired and their default behavior is prevented.

I want the test to be centred in the dropzone, at the moment it is written in the top left hand corner. Can you adjust the code so its centred inside the dropzone bother horizontally and vertically

<strong>Response</strong><br> 
Sure! You can centre the text inside the #dropzone element both horizontally and vertically by adding the following CSS code:

```css
#dropzone {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
}
```


+This code will centre the text inside the #dropzone element by using flexbox. You can add this code to your existing CSS code to apply the new style. Let me know if you have any questions or if there’s anything else I can help with!<br>

Lets change up the colour scheme as I don’t like it. Change the colour scheme via CSS to one of black, dark grey, and bright green.

<strong>Response</strong><br> 
Sure! Here’s a colour scheme that incorporates black, dark grey, and bright green that you can try for your page:

```css
body {
  background-color: #333333;
}

h1 {
  color: #00FF00;
}

p {
  color: #FFFFFF;
}

#dropzone {
  border-color: #00FF00;
}

button {
  background-color: #00FF00;
  color: black;
}
```

This code will give your page a dark grey background with bright green accents and white text. You can add this code to your existing CSS code to apply the new colour scheme. Let me know if you have any questions or if there’s anything else I can help with!<br>

Merge the CSS code you just generated to the CSS I am already using below 

```css
body {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  height: 100vh;
  background-color: #E6E6FA;
}

h1 {
  color: #4169E1;
}

p {
  color: #000080;
}

#dropzone {
  border-color: #4169E1;
  width: 300px;
  height: 100px;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
}

button {
  background-color: #4169E1;
  color: white;
}

@media (max-width: 600px) {
  #dropzone {
    width: 80%;
  }

  #rewind,
  #fastforward {
    width: 100%;
    padding: 10px;
    margin: 5px;
  }
}
```

<strong>Response</strong><br> 
Sure! Here is the complete CSS code that includes both the new colour scheme and the other styles you mentioned:

```css
body {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  height: 100vh;
  background-color: #333333;
}

h1 {
  color: #00FF00;
}

p {
  color: #FFFFFF;
}

#dropzone {
  border-color: #00FF00;
  width: 300px;
  height: 100px;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
}

button {
  background-color: #00FF00;
  color: black;
}

@media (max-width: 600px) {
  #dropzone {
    width: 80%;
  }

  #rewind,
  #fastforward {
    width: 100%;
    padding: 10px;
    margin: 5px;

Can we change the html and CSS so on desktop computers the fast forward and rewind buttons are side by side on the same row. And on mobile devices they change to be stacked on top of each other. The breakpoint to enable this change is 786px

<strong>Response</strong><br> 
Sure! You can achieve this by wrapping the #rewind and #fastforward buttons in a div element and adding the following CSS code:

```html
<div id="button-container">
  <button id="rewind">Rewind</button>
  <button id="fastforward">Fast Forward</button>
</div>
```

```css
#button-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
}

@media (max-width: 786px) {
  #button-container {
    flex-direction: column;
  }
}
```

This code will display the #rewind and #fastforward buttons side by side on the same row on desktop computers and stack them on top of each other on mobile devices with a screen width of 786px or less. You can add this code to your existing HTML and CSS code to apply the new styles. Let me know if you have any questions or if there’s anything else I can help with!<br>

Add some margin and padding to this element of html so it’s not so close to the other elements. 

```html
<input type="file" id="fileinput" accept="audio/*">
```

<strong>Response</strong><br> 
Sure! You can add some margin and padding to the #fileinput element by adding the following CSS code:

```css
#fileinput {
  margin: 10px;
  padding: 5px;
}
```

This code will add 10px of margin and 5px of padding to the #fileinput element, which will create some space between it and the other elements on the page. You can adjust the values of the margin and padding properties to your liking. You can add this code to your existing CSS code to apply the new style.

Change the CSS so this element has the same CSS as the fast-forward and rewind buttons.

```html
<input type="file" id="fileinput" accept="audio/*">
```

<strong>Response</strong><br> 
Sure! You can apply the same styles to the #fileinput element a the #rewind and #fastforward buttons by adding the following CSS code:

```css
#fileinput {
  background-color: #00FF00;
  color: black;
  padding: 10px;
  margin: 5px;
}

@media (max-width: 786px) {
  #fileinput {
    width: 100%;
  }
}
```

This code will apply the same background colour, text colour, padding, and margin to the #fileinput element as the #rewind and #fastforward buttons. It will also make the #fileinput element 100% width on mobile devices with a screen width of 786px or less. You can add this code to your existing CSS code to apply the new styles.

At this point i did a small rearranging of the HTML code so the error message appears below the buttons. This brings the buttons directly up to under the song name so it has a better aesthetic.

<summary>10. Project summary</summary>
<br>

At this point i could do more CSS to give the player a better aesthetic look, however, i wanted to use this project to demonstrate how you could take an idea and build a fully functioning project of HTML, CSS and Javascript using as little as 24 prompts using Bing chat.  

Also this entire project took me around 15 minutes from asking my initial prompt to having a finished fully functioning audio player.

HTML: 37 Lines of code<br>
CSS: 65 Lines of code<br>
Javascript: 89 Lines of code<br>
