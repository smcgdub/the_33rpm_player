# **The 33 RPM Player** #
![]()

## **Introduction** ##
A few years ago somebody uploaded the song Jolene by Dolly Parton that was played on a record player at 33rpm instead of the intended 45rpm, you can listen to that song on YouTube by clicking [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMrfM711vXI). 

The song gained a lot of attention online as many people thought it sounded as good as, if not better than the original. I thought what other songs would sound good at 33rpm, hence the inspiration for this project. 

I also haven’t built a project yet using ChatGPT, so for this simple project I said I would build the entire thing using nothing more than prompts on Bing chat which is powered by ChatGPT 4.  

Im also very well aware that you can watch a music video on YouTube or on any media player and set the speed to a slower speed to achieve the same effect. This project was not about building a new technology. It was about seeing how i could build a simple project using nothing more than prompts on Bing chat with little or no coding from me as the developer.

The full conversation with bing chat and all of the prompts, replies and code generated can be found in section 9 of this document. My summary on the project can be read in section 10.

<summary>1. User Experience (UX)</summary>
<br>

### **1.1 - Target Audience** ###

Anyone who wishes to hear one of their favourite songs played at 33rpm.

### **1.2 - Visitor goals** ###

As a visitor to The 33RPM Player I want to be able to upload a song and hear it played at 33rpm.

### **1.3 - User Stories** ###

**As a visitor to The 33RPM Player want/expect/need:**

1. A simple user interface that is easy to navigate.
2. To be able to upload a song and hear it played at 33rpm.
3. To be able to fast forward and rewind the song.
4. To be able to see the name of the song that is playing.
5. To be able to see an error message if i try to upload a file that is not an audio file.

### **1.4 - Design Choices** ###

As i made this project completely using prompts in Bing chat i decided i would make any design choices in advance and decide on things as i go. 

**COLOURS**

I would prompt Bing chat with different requests as the project progressed and then use the responses to help me decide on the design choices.

<summary>2. Features</summary>
<br>

### **2.1 - The drop zone** ###

The clearly marked drop zone is where desktop users must drag the audio file they wish to listen to at 33rpm.

### **2.2 - Upload file** ###

For mobile users who don't have the drag and drop functionality they can click on the upload file button and select the file they wish to listen to at 33rpm.

### **2.3 - The player** ###

A standard HTML player that Bing chat generated when i gave it the prompt.


### **2.4 - Fast Forward & Rewind Buttons** ###

The fast forward and rewind buttons are standard HTML buttons that Bing chat generated when i gave it the prompt. The Javascript behind them allows users to skip forward or backwards by 10 seconds per click. All of the Javascript functionality was generated by Bing chat when i gave it the prompt.

### **2.5 - Song Name** ###

The song/file name is displayed to the user after the player loads it.

### **2.6 - Error Message** ###

If the user tries to upload a file that is not an audio file they will be presented with an error message.

Below you can see the entire conversation i had with Bing chat to build this project. Text written in green is the response from Bing chat. All of the code generated that you see below was generated from Bing chat. 

<hr>

Prompt 1: I want to build a website where users can drag an audio file and an audio player will play the song back at 33rpm. Let’s discuss the tech stack needed to do this

Sure! To build a website with the functionality you described, you’ll need to use a combination of front-end and back-end technologies. For the front-end, you can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the user interface and handle user interactions such as dragging and dropping an audio file. For the back-end, you can use a server-side language such as PHP or Node.js to process the audio file and play it back at 33rpm. You’ll also need a web server such as Apache or Nginx to host your website.

Is there a specific technology or language you prefer to use?<br>

<hr>

Prompt 2: The user won’t be able to store any music, they will only be able to drag and drop 1 song at a time, so no need for any backend

In that case, you can build the website using only front-end technologies. You can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the user interface and handle user interactions such as dragging and dropping an audio file. You can also use JavaScript to process the audio file and play it back at 33rpm using the Web Audio API.

Do you have any experience with these technologies?<br>

Prompt 3: Yes I have experience with these. Can you generate the html code for me?

+Sure! Here’s a basic HTML template that you can use as a starting point for your website:
```

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Audio Player</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Audio Player</h1>
    <p>Drag and drop an audio file here:</p>
    <div id="dropzone" style="width: 300px; height: 100px; border: 2px dashed #ccc;"></div>
    <audio id="player" controls></audio>
    <script>
      // Your JavaScript code goes here
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

```diff
+This template includes a dropzone element where users can drag and drop an audio file, and an audio element to play the file. You’ll need to add your own JavaScript code to handle the drag and drop event and play the audio file at 33rpm.

+Is there anything else you need help with?

```

```diff
Prompt 4: OK, now let’s write the JavaScript. When the user drags and drops a song into the player I want the song to start playing at 33rpm automatically. Generate this JavaScript code for me and add it to the html file you generated previously.

+Sure! Here’s the updated HTML template with the added JavaScript code to handle the drag and drop event and play the audio file at 33rpm:
```

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>

    <h1>Audio Player</h1>
    <p>Drag and drop an audio file here:</p>
    <div id="dropzone" style="width: 300px; height: 100px; border: 2px dashed #ccc;"></div>
    <audio id="player" controls></audio>
    <script>
      // Get the dropzone and player elements
      const dropzone = document.querySelector('#dropzone');
      const player = document.querySelector('#player');

      // Handle the dragover event
      dropzone.addEventListener('dragover', (event) => {
        event.preventDefault();
      });

      // Handle the drop event
      dropzone.addEventListener('drop', (event) => {
        event.preventDefault();

        // Get the dropped file
        const file = event.dataTransfer.files[0];

        // Create a file reader
        const reader = new FileReader();
        reader.onload = (event) => {
          // Set the audio source and play the file at 33rpm
          player.src = event.target.result;
          player.playbackRate = 0.5;
          player.play();
        };
        reader.readAsDataURL(file);
      });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

```diff
+This code adds event listeners to the dropzone element to handle the dragover and drop events. When a user drags a file over the dropzone, the dragover event is fired and the default behaviour is prevented. When a user drops a file onto the dropzone, the drop event is fired and the dropped file is read using a FileReader. Once the file is read, its data is set as the source of the audio element and played back at 33rpm using the playbackRate property.

Prompt 5: I also want the name of the file to be displayed below the player. Generate this code for me and add it to the code

Prompt 9. Is there a way we can check if the user is dropping or uploading a none audio file? If so how do we check this? And if it’s not an audio file that the player can play, can we generate a message to the user to say "Sorry the type of file you are trying to load cannot be played in this player"

+Yes, it is possible to check if the user is dropping or uploading a non-audio file. You can do this by checking the type property of the dropped or selected file to see if it starts with audio/. If the file is not an audio file, you can display a message to the user to let them know that the file cannot be played.

+Here’s the updated HTML template with the added code to check if the dropped or selected file is an audio file and display a message if it’s not:

```

```css
body {
  background-color: #333333;
}

h1 {
  color: #00FF00;
}

p {
  color: #FFFFFF;
}

#dropzone {
  border-color: #00FF00;
}

button {
  background-color: #00FF00;
  color: black;
}
```

Prompt 22: Can we change the html and CSS so on desktop computers the fast forward and rewind buttons are side by side on the same row. And on mobile devices they change to be stacked on top of each other. The breakpoint to enable this change is 786px

+Sure! You can achieve this by wrapping the #rewind and #fastforward buttons in a div element and adding the following CSS code:
```

```html
<div id="button-container">
  <button id="rewind">Rewind</button>
  <button id="fastforward">Fast Forward</button>
</div>
```

```css
#button-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
}

@media (max-width: 786px) {
  #button-container {
    flex-direction: column;
  }
}
```

```diff
+This code will display the #rewind and #fastforward buttons side by side on the same row on desktop computers and stack them on top of each other on mobile devices with a screen width of 786px or less. You can add this code to your existing HTML and CSS code to apply the new styles. Let me know if you have any questions or if there’s anything else I can help with!

At this point i did a small rearranging of the HTML code so the error message appears below the buttons. This brings the buttons directly up to under the song name so it has a better aesthetic.

<summary>10. Project summary</summary>
<br>

At this point i could do more CSS to give the player a better aesthetic look, however, i wanted to use this project to demonstrate how you could take an idea and build a fully functioning project of HTML, CSS and Javascript using as little as 24 prompts using Bing chat.  

Also this entire project took me around 15 minutes from asking my initial prompt to having a finished fully functioning audio player.

HTML: 37 Lines of code<br>
CSS: 65 Lines of code<br>
Javascript: 89 Lines of code<br>
Total: 191 Lines of code
